# Analysis and Modelling of Telecom Churn

Customers in the telecom industry can actively switch between operators and have access to a wide range of service providers. In this intensely competitive sector, the telecoms industry experiences a high churn rate. Due to the fact that acquiring new customers is 5 to10 times more expensive than maintaining existing ones, client retention has now exceeded customer acquisition in importance.For many established operators, keeping highly profitable customers is their primary business goal.To lower customer turnover, telecom companies must identify the customers who are most likely to depart. The main objective is to look at customer-level data from a leading telecom business and prediction models to identify consumers most likely to depart(customers who are more likely to leave the service), and analyzing the results to make decisions accordingly. Companies are seeking statistical analysis and machine learning solutions to reduce churn. The main focus of this study is on analysis of the data for a telecom chain through Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Extraction and Predictive Modelling. Through the process the factors that impact churn and also understand the pattern of customers who are athigh risk of churn are known.
